# RSS Reader SharePoint Webpart

## Summary
This webpart allows you to include an RSS feed of your choice into a Modern SharePoint page. The only required piece of information is the link to the RSS feed, however you can configure a title to display, as well as how many results you'd like displayed and how many characters are displayed in the descriptions.

This RSS Reader is built on top of [OlivierCC's](https://github.com/OlivierCC/spfx-40-fantastics) original from the 40 Fantastic Webparts repository. This version allows you to download the RSS Reader on it's own. This is a much smaller and managable package, and built in SPFx version 1.4.1 so no configuration is required, you can simply download the `ress-reader.sppkg` file in the `sharepoint` folder if you'd like to start using it right away.
